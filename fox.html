    <h2>Fox</h2>
    <p>They range in size and color but are dog-like in appearance with pointed ears, <br />
      long snouts, thick fur, and long bushy tails. Wild foxes tend to live for around 6-7 years, <br />
      but some foxes have been known to be older than 13 in captivity. The wild fox hunts mice and other small mammals, <br />
      amphibians, and birds.<p>
