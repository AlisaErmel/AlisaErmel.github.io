    <h2>Fox</h2>
    <p><br> They range in size and color but are dog-like in appearance with pointed ears, <br />
      <br> long snouts, thick fur, and long bushy tails. Wild foxes tend to live for around 6-7 years, <br />
      <br> but some foxes have been known to be older than 13 in captivity. The wild fox hunts mice and other small mammals, <br />
      <br> amphibians, and birds.<br /><p>
