    <h2>Cat</h2>
    <p><br> The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: <br />
        <br> it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, <br />
        <br> and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. <br />
        <br> Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed.<br /><p>
